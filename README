Grouter V1
----------

A simple router for Goliath. I built this more for learning than anyone else. If anything is wonky, dumb, or totally unnecessary please let me know...

Usage
-----

Inside your server.rb file:

	require 'router.rb'
	
	class Framework < Goliath::API
	
	...

	  def process_request
		Router.initialize! env['REQUEST_PATH'], env['REQUEST_METHOD'] # => Sets up incoming route
		Router.mix_and_match # => Finds the route (final route)
		# Dispatcher::call(Router::RouteMap.final_route, params) # => Generic dispatcher to call the final route
	  end

	  def response(env)
		unless env['REQUEST_PATH'] == '/favicon.ico'
			[200, {}, process_request]
		else
			[200, {}, "favicon.ico"]
		end
	  end
	end

The example above uses Goliath::Rack::Params for the params variable.

To Do
-----

*Error handling
*Make sure non-"GET" requests work
